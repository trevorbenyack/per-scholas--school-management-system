# School Management System

## To Do:

- Add "search for user" functionality to search bar
    - This should only should be displayed to admins
- Add Instructor menu
- Change login page to something more visually pleasing
- Add logout link
- Add following admin functionalities:
    - Register Student to a course
      - maybe two columns w/ a list of courses on the left, and then a list of instructors on the right, could do a multi-select for instructors
    - View all courses
    - Add a user
- Probably a ton of other stuff I can't think of right now lol
