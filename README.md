# School Management System

## To Do:
- Create template fragments for side and top nav bars
    - Will need to figure out a way to pass in variable letting the side bar fragment know which page should be highlighted.
- Add "getUserByEmail" functionality to search bar
    - This should only should be displayed to admins
- Add "Register for course" functionality for course list template
    - This should be hidden if user is an instructor, but shown for admins when searching for a student.
    - Should not increase size of page, should instead scroll in its own <div>
- Finalize which Navigation items will appear in side nav bar (along w/ appropriate icons), and which will appear in the top nav bar.
- Prepare login template
- Add admin functionality to add an instructor to a course
    - maybe two columns w/ a list of courses on the left, and then a list of instructors on the right, could do a multi-select for instructors
- Probably a ton of other stuff I can't think of right now lol
